#Overview 
VegetarianMod is a Minecraft Forge mod that allows you to shear chickens for feathers and milk squids for ink (like cows). A very small mod.

# Shearable Chickens
- Use shears on chickens to shear their feathers.
- Chickens will appear to have patchy feathers when shorn. (You shouldn't cut blood feathers - the point is not to hurt the chicken!)
- Like sheep, chickens will occasionally eat grass. If a shorn chicken eats grass, it will regrow its feathers.

# Inkable Squids
- To "ink" a squid, simply right click it with a bucket. You will get a bucket of ink.

# Cauldrons
- Cauldrons can hold ink. To fill a cauldron with ink, right-click it with a bucket of ink (obtained by inking a squid). The ink level of a filled cauldron is 3.
- If a cauldron contains any ink, it cannot be filled with water or rain.
- You can get a bottle of ink by right-clicking an ink-filled cauldron with an empty glass bottle. The ink level in the cauldron decreases by one each time this occurs. 

# Ink Bottles
- Ink bottles can be used in any crafting recipe to replace ink sacs. (Unfortunately, this consumes the bottle as well as the ink. I haven't figured out how to fix this issue yet. But glass is easy to come by.)

# Known Issues
- Display names are weird. Either they're in italics, or a the game defaults to an unpleasant java-object type name.
